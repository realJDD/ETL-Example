#Project Title
Are baby names influenced by HR hitters?

#Scope
1. We will use kaggle dataset of USA names (1910-2013)(https://www.kaggle.com/datagov/usa-names)
2. We will use ESPN home run leaders dataset (2012) (http://www.espn.com/mlb/stats/batting/_/year/2012/sort/homeRuns/order/true).

We will download the names dataset into a csv format, and we will scrape the table dataset from the ESPN website.
